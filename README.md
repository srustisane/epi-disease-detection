# Detection of Diseases using Electrophotonic Imaging (EPI)

The pancreas and liver are the organs which produce insulin and regulate blood sugar respectively, which is one of the main hormones that helps to regulate diabetes. Electrophotonic imaging is a process that measures the energy fields of humans. The Electrophotonic Imaging (EPI) instrument is used to capture coronal discharges at the fingertips induced by a pulsed electrical signal (10-15kV, 1024Hz, 10- microsecond) on the glass plate of the camera. The EPI instrument is based on the stimulation of photon and electron emissions from the surface of the object. In this process, the images are captured by a highly specialized camera referred to as a GDV (gas discharge visualization), EPC or EPI camera. The camera must be placed at certain angles in order to perform the imaging of the desired organ i.e pancreas and liver. From the EPI dataset collected from SVYASA Institute which consisted of 53 diabetic patients and 58 healthy individuals, parameters such as mean, entropy, intensity, fractality, and root mean square were found. Further, classification is performed to predict the onset of diabetes. The parameters found are used for training the network. For Support-Vector Machine classification, inputs are the parameters found and the expected output is diabetic or non-diabetic.
